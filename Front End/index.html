            <h4>Cholesterol</h4></center>
            Cholesterol helps your body build new cells, insulate nerves, and produce hormones. Normally, the liver makes all the cholesterol the body needs. But cholesterol also enters your body from food, such as animal-based foods like milk, eggs, and meat. Too much cholesterol in your body is a risk factor for heart disease.When there is too much cholesterol in your blood, it builds up in the walls of your arteries, causing a process called atherosclerosis, a form of heart disease. The arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart muscle is slowed down or blocked. The blood carries oxygen to the heart, and if not enough blood and oxygen reach your heart, you may suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a blockage, the result is a heart attack.

<h4>Angina</h4></center>
Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The discomfort also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.Angina can also be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). This is heart disease that affects the heart’s smallest coronary arteries and is more likely to affect women than men. Coronary MVD also is called cardiac syndrome X and non-obstructive CHD.

<h4>Blood Pressure</h4></center>
Blood pressure is the force against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood throughout your body.For the average person who is not at high risk for hypertension, we aim for a total blood pressure of 120/80 or lower. If your blood pressure is higher than 120/80, you could be at risk for heart disease.As we age, our risk for high blood pressure increases. More than 76 percent of men age 75 and older have it, and nearly 80 percent of women have high blood pressure by the time they reach age 75. It has been said that hypertension is a “disease” that everyone will get if they live long enough!

        <h4>Heart Rate</h4></center>
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.When your heart rate is too fast, it’s called tachycardia. For adults, a fast heart rate is generally defined as a heart rate over 100 beats per minute.When your heart rate is too slow, it’s referred to as bradycardia. Bradycardia is typically defined as a heart rate that’s less than 60 beats per minute.

<h4>ECG</h4></center>
The electrocardiogram, also referred to as ECG, 12-lead ECG, or EKG, is a non-invasive diagnostic test that evaluates your heart's electrical system to assess for heart disease. It uses flat metal electrodes placed on your chest to detect the electrical charges generated by your heart as it beats, which are then graphed.An ECG detects your heart's electrical rhythm and produces what's known as a tracing, which looks like squiggly lines.

          <div class="col-12 " color="white"><center><h4>Diabeties</h4></center>
Having diabetes means that you are more likely to develop heart disease and have a greater chance of a heart attack or a stroke. People with diabetes are also more likely to have certain conditions, or risk factors, that increase the chances of having heart disease or stroke, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you have diabetes, you can protect your heart and health by managing your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, as well as your blood pressure and cholesterol

                  <div class="col-12 " color="white"><center><h4>Fasting Blood Sugar</h4></center>
A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.
