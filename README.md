Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Used different types of machine learning models such as SVM, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, etc in Python.

You'll need to setup a xampp server first to run this application, since it has been developed with MySQL and PHP as backend services.

Flask framework is being used here to be able to send the data captured by the end user (which is taken from a webpage) to the machine learning model which has been already created and tested.

Please find the dataset used in this application, and the various operations being performed on it before actually feeding this data to the machine learning algorithm such as
data cleaning, data scaling, eliminating outliers, etc.

Also some files consisting of various tests performed in Postman are also saved, so please have a look at that also!
